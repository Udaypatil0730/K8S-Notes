🚀 Kubernetes YAML Cheat Sheet (Easy-to-Remember)
YAML File	Purpose	Needs Container Image?	Trick to Remember
Deployment.yaml	Runs stateless apps (Pods)	✅ Yes	D = Docker Image
StatefulSet.yaml	Runs stateful apps (DB, Kafka)	✅ Yes	S = Stateful + Storage → Needs Image
DaemonSet.yaml	Runs one Pod per Node	✅ Yes	D = Daemon → Docker everywhere
Job.yaml / CronJob.yaml	Run tasks/batch jobs	✅ Yes	Jobs need a worker image
Pod.yaml	Direct Pod definition	✅ Yes	Pod = Pure container
Service.yaml	Exposes Pods internally/externally	❌ No	Service = Switchboard, not container
Ingress.yaml	Routes external traffic	❌ No	Ingress = Internet Gate, no container
ConfigMap.yaml	Store configs (non-secret)	❌ No	Config ≠ Code
Secret.yaml	Store sensitive data (keys/pwds)	❌ No	Secret ≠ Software
PersistentVolume.yaml	Define storage (disk, EBS, NFS)	❌ No	PV = Physical Volume, not container
PersistentVolumeClaim.yaml	Claim storage for Pod	❌ No	PVC = Please give me storage
ServiceAccount.yaml	Pod identity	❌ No	Account ≠ Application
Role / RoleBinding.yaml	Access control (RBAC)	❌ No	Role = Rules, not runtime
🧠 Easy Memory Tricks:

If YAML = Runs Pods → Needs Image
(Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob, Pod)

If YAML = Just Helps/Supports → No Image
(Service, Ingress, ConfigMap, Secret, PV, PVC, RBAC)

✅ With this, in interviews you can confidently say:

“Container images are only specified in Pod-level controllers (Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, Pod). All other YAML files like Service, Ingress, ConfigMap, Secret, or PV/PVC are supporting resources, so they don’t need an image.”

Would you like me to also prepare a mnemonic (one-liner trick) like a small sentence to instantly recall which YAMLs need images?

perfect thanks so we will wind up today I mean let's give me the cheat sheet for all day three so that I can close this you know how to create a cheat sheet we already did for last two days create for today itself also

Got it Uday 👍 Let’s wrap up Day 3 with your Kubernetes Cheat Sheet (just like we did for Day 1 & Day 2). I’ll keep it crisp, easy-to-remember, and “interview-ready.”

📘 Kubernetes Day 3 – Cheat Sheet
1. Kubernetes YAML Basics

YAML = declarative way to define Kubernetes objects.

Structure:

apiVersion:
kind:
metadata:
spec:


Rule: Every YAML must have apiVersion, kind, metadata.
spec changes depending on the object.

2. Core YAML Types

Pod.yaml → Smallest deployable unit, needs container image.

Deployment.yaml → Manages Pods (stateless apps).

StatefulSet.yaml → Manages stateful apps (DB, Kafka).

DaemonSet.yaml → Runs Pod on every node (logging, monitoring agents).

Job.yaml / CronJob.yaml → Run tasks/batch jobs.

Service.yaml → Exposes Pods (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).

Ingress.yaml → Routes traffic using DNS/host/path rules.

ConfigMap.yaml → Inject config (non-secret).

Secret.yaml → Inject sensitive data (passwords, keys).

PV / PVC.yaml → Manage storage.

RBAC (Role/RoleBinding/ServiceAccount.yaml) → Access control.

3. Trick: Which YAML Needs a Container Image?

✅ Needs image: Pod, Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob
❌ Doesn’t need image: Service, Ingress, ConfigMap, Secret, PV, PVC, RBAC

👉 Rule to remember:
If it runs Pods → Needs Image. If it supports Pods → No Image.

4. Service Types (Quick Recall)

ClusterIP (default) → Internal only.

NodePort → Opens a port on each Node.

LoadBalancer → Exposes app externally (cloud LB).

ExternalName → Maps to DNS name.

Trick: C → Internal Cluster, N → Node, L → LoadBalancer (outside world)

5. Easy Mnemonics

YAML = apiVersion + kind + metadata + spec.

Images only in Pod-level controllers (D, S, D, J, C, P).
(Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob, Pod)

Services = Switchboard, Ingress = Internet Gate.

Config ≠ Code, Secret ≠ Software.
