## Kuberneties Clustor upgrade ##

“In my last cluster upgrade project, we upgraded kubeadm clusters from one minor release to the next across dev → staging → prod. My process is: (1) Read release notes and prepare a compatibility matrix for apps and CRDs; (2) take a full etcd snapshot and store it in S3 with versioning and retention policy; (3) test the whole upgrade in a staging cluster that mirrors prod; (4) on production, upgrade kubeadm on the primary control plane, run kubeadm upgrade plan and kubeadm upgrade apply vX.Y.Z, then upgrade kubelet and kubectl on control planes and verify system pods; (5) upgrade CNI/CoreDNS if needed; (6) cordon/drain and upgrade worker nodes one by one, running smoke tests and monitoring Prometheus for any anomalies; (7) have an immediate rollback path (etcd restore + helm/GitOps rollback) which I’ve rehearsed. This approach ensured zero data loss, minimal downtime, and quick recovery — and we automated repeatable parts with Ansible and CI jobs to reduce human error.”
